# Hello, I'm Noé 👋

Second-year engineering student at [Télécom SudParis](https://www.telecom-sudparis.eu/en/), passionate about finance, data, and algorithms.  
Currently building a strong background in statistics, optimization, and software engineering through personal and academic projects.

In addition to coursework, I’ve been actively exploring quantitative finance, algorithmic trading, and responsible computing through hands-on projects.

Feel free to check out some of my work below 👇

###  [Mini-Facebook](https://github.com/nonotsp/mini-facebook)

A minimalist social network implemented in Bash.  
Users can create accounts, add friends, post messages, and view their wall.  
Designed to explore process synchronization and interprocess communication with named pipes.

### [Order Book Simulator](https://github.com/nonotsp/order-book-simulator)

**Order Book Simulator** is a Java-based simulation of a financial order book, supporting both market and limit orders.  
This project was built as part of my academic and personal work during my second year at Télécom SudParis.

## About the Project

This simulator models a central limit order book, matching buy and sell orders using price and FIFO priority.  
It supports:

-  Limit orders (BUY / SELL)
-  Market orders (BUY / SELL)
-  FIFO matching (First-In-First-Out)
-  Order book visualization (terminal view) *(new)*
-  CSV-based execution (stream of orders) *(new)*
-  Multi-order processing via algorithmic runner *(new)*


### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nonotsp/order-book-simulator.git
cd order-book-simulator
```
### 2. Compile the project

```bash
javac src/*.java
```


### 3. Run the simulation

```bash
java src.Main
```
It will read and execute orders from the orders.csv file.

### [Kalman Filtering – Target Tracking](https://github.com/nonotsp/kalman-tracking-project)

Kalman Filtering applied to the estimation of object trajectories from noisy sensor data.  
Developed during the *Statistical Filtering* course at Télécom SudParis, this project includes both synthetic simulations and real-world applications (e.g., aircraft tracking).

## About the Project

The goal is to estimate the position and velocity of a moving target using probabilistic state-space models.  
The project is divided into three main parts:

- **Synthetic Scenario** – Simulation of a mobile object and reconstruction via standard Kalman Filter  
- **Aircraft Tracking** – Application to real 2D trajectory data with missing observations  
- **Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)** – Adaptation to nonlinear polar observations (angle and distance)

Includes a full implementation from scratch, error analysis, and performance visualization.

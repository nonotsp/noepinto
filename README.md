### [Order Book Simulator](https://github.com/nonotsp/order-book-simulator)

**Order Book Simulator** is a Java-based simulation of a financial order book, supporting both market and limit orders.  
This project was built as part of my academic and personal work during my second year at Télécom SudParis.

## About the Project

This simulator models a central limit order book, matching buy and sell orders using price and FIFO priority.  
It supports:

-  Limit orders (BUY / SELL)
-  Market orders (BUY / SELL)
-  FIFO matching (First-In-First-Out)
-  Order book visualization (terminal view) *(new)*
-  CSV-based execution (stream of orders) *(new)*
-  Multi-order processing via algorithmic runner *(new)*
